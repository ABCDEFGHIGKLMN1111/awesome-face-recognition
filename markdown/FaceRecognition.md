## Abstract

* Summarize different network architectures and loss functions
* Categorize face processing methods into two classes.
  * "one-to-many augmentation"
  * "many-to-one normalization"
* Compare the commonly used database



## Introduction

* **The milestiones of feature-based Face Recognition**

  * The holistic approaches derive the low-dimensional representation (1990 ~ 2000)

    * Linear subspace
    * Manifold
    * Sparse representation
    * Fail to address the uncontrolled facial changes that deviate from their prior assumptions.
      

  * Local feature based Face Recognition (early 2000s)

    * Multilevel and high-dimensional extensions
      * Gabor
      * LBP
    * Handcrafted features suffered from a lack of distinctiveness and compactness.
      

  * Learning-based local descriptors (early 2010s)

    * One or two layer representation

    * Shallow representations still have an inevitable limitation on robustness against the complex nonlinear facial appearance variations.

  * Deep learning methods, CNN (2012~)

    * The hierarchical architecture of deep Face Recognition.

    * DeepFace (2014) : achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy on the famous LFW benchmark, approaching human performance on the unconstrained condition.
